# Pomodoro
## Information
In this project, a calculator is implemented using Javascript. This project is part of The Odin Project Javascript curriculum. The project information can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project).
## Instructions
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), there are six steps to the pomodoro technique.
1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task.
4. End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
This pomodoro timer is already set to 25 minutes, so once you have decided on the task, just hit the play button! If you need to take a break, just hit the pause button and hit play when you get back! To reset the timer back to the 25/5 minute setup, hit the stop button (step 6). If you changed the times, hit the restart button to go back to the original setup.
